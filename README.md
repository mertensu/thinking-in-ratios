# Readme

This repository contains the data and scripts (R-notebooks + .pdf files) for the three main studies (data_total_study1.csv – data_total_study3.csv) and a supplemental study (data_total_supp.csv) reported in the manuscript "On the Difficulty to Think in Ratios: A Methodological Bias in Stevens’ Magnitude Estimation Procedure". In addition, we uploaded a _Transparency Report_. 

The .Rmd files are standalone, i.e. you can download them and directly run all cells without having to care about missing packages (will be installed if not available) or data (will be imported directly from this repo).
